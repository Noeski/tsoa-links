## Songs
Songs contain powerful magic in the world of Awakening and some of these songs can be used in combat. To play a song, first the player's energy bar must be filled either through attacking or successful parries.

Once filled, the player can briefly stop time around them and play their instrument.

Various songs can be found while exploring and can be equipped or swapped out for the right situation.
